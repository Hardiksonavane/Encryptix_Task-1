        <h2>E-commerce website (RedStore Shopify)</h2>
        <p>Crafting a dynamic PHP e-commerce website involves a blend of meticulous planning, innovative coding,
            and seamless integration of technologies. The process begins with thorough analysis of the requirements,
            followed by strategic planning and design.</p>

            <h2>Frontend Development:</h2><p> HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are utilized to create responsive and visually
                appealing user interfaces. We leverage frontend frameworks like Bootstrap for efficient layout design
                and cross-browser compatibility.</p>

        
        <h2>Backend Development:</h2><p>PHP serves as the backbone of the e-commerce websites, providing robust
        server-side scripting for dynamic content generation and database interactions.
        </p>

        <h2>Database Management:</h2><p> MySQL databases have been used to store product information, user data, and
            transaction records. Implemented optimized database structures and queries to ensure fast and reliable

        <p>The aim is to predict the future value of the financial stocks of a company. The recent trend in stock market prediction 
            technologies is the use of machine learning which makes predictions based on the values of current stock market indices 
            by training on their previous values. We are going to use historical data and then refine it, do the cleaning of data and use it 
            as a source for our prediction model</p>
